        <p>
            This website is like my public repository for web content. There are a handful 
            of little html/css/javascript pages scattered about.
            Have a look around<a href="../blug/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">!</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have an affinity for simplicity and playfulness of early web pages. 
            It's becoming less frequent that I come across these basic, fun, here-it-is pages. 
            By using minimal javascript and straightforward HTML/CSS I hope to keep that spirit intact here. :]
