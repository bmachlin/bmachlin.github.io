				<p>Hi! I'm a person existing in the world right now. At least I think so . . .</p>

				
				<p>Visit my <a href="index.html">homepage</a> or look at my <a href="resume.html">dank resume</a>!!</p>

				<p>I was hiking through the mountains on a cool but sunny day when I happened upon a strange habitat. It was carved into the base of a towering, ancient tree. The opening was not much bigger than a small gourd or perhaps three large mushrooms, and the surrounding grass was worn from heavy use. I continued to examine the dwelling; I had never seen anything like it in all my travels.</p>

				<p><span class="rabit">"You'd better not stay long, fella. That thing doesn't seem to like visitors,"</span> a small voice chimed from behind me.</p>

				<p>I turned to face the voice and was greeted by a rabbit, its body halfway out of its rabbit hole. <span class="self">"Oh hello, Mr. Rabbit. Why is that?"</span></p>

				<p><span class="rabbit">"My name's Henry,"</span> the rabbit named Henry replied, slightly iritated. He continued, <span class="rabbit">"I've never seem what lives in there but nothing that's gone in has ever come out."</span> 

				<p><span class="self">"Don't worry, Henry. My friends aren't far behind me, they'll have my back."</span> His nosed continued twitching like a rabbit's nose does. Then he disappeared silently into the ground.</p>

				<p>I turned to face the hole again. <span class="tree">"He's right, you know,"</span> the tree rumbled. I couldn't be sure if it was the tree speaking to me or a mysterious creature that dwelt inside it.</p>

				<p class="tree">"Though I have learned much over the many years I've occupied this hillside, I lack the ability to see inside myself. I fear what lies in my trunk will be my demise."</p>

				<p class="self">"Is it hurting you?"</p>

				<p><span class="tree">"While I can survive without the flesh it has seized, it has nearly severed my connection to the forest. A tree like me cannot survive alone."</span> I could feel the ground vibrate slightly in tune with the voice and could hear the age in its tone. I was undoubtedly speaking with the tree itself.</p>

				<p><span class="self">"I'm sorry to hear that."</span> I mused for a moment then sat in front of the opening.</p>

				<p>I couldn't see very far inside so I cautiously moved closer to get a better look. Yet, I still could not see much. Curiosity gripped me like a constricting vine. I placed my backpack next to the tree, laid down and stuck my face into the opening.</p>

				<p><span class="self">"Oh my. It's actually quite spacious in here,"</span> I announced to the tree, unsure of whether it could hear me from the inside.</p>

				<p>I slowly crawled my way all the way in to the cavernous arboreal chamber and began my wait.</p>

				<p>I had seen the other hikers on the same trail as I took. They were sure to pass by soon and spot the bait.</p>
