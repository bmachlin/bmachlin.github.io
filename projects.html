            <p>
                I recreated the classic word unscrambling webgame Text Twist but added my own features.
                Most notably, you can advance to a new level as soon as you get the pangram. The UI is...simple, 
                but it works and is fun!

            <h2><a href="/chronography/" target="_blank">Chronography</a></h2>
            <p>
                A proof-of-concept web app that allows you to compare musical attributes of songs over the
                course of an album, playlist, or artist's career. You can find the source at <a
                    href="https://github.com/bmachlin/chronography" target="_blank">this repo</a>.

            <p>
                Super simple web tool that lets you paste tablature (or any text really) with time stamps
                and it will scroll at the appropriate speed. Ability to with YouTube video.

            <h2>Persimmon Project App</h2>
            <p>
                A cross-platform mobile app that allowed investors insight into the portfolio performance as well as news and updates.
                Developed with Ionic. The app was live-updated with data from a financial portfolio service.

            <h2>Musique</h2>
            <p>
                A senior capstone project that implemented democratic music queuing. Users could host and
                join "parties" in which party-goers could queue songs and vote on songs in the queue. The queue would
                automatically sort by number of votes and playback through the host's device. We used the Spotify
                API and Firebase to create a functional Android app.
