     We all fuck up, a lot. I fuck up constantly. Whether it's a bug in some code, or being mean, or slacking on some responsibility, the best practice is 
                to address the errorr
     <em>
      as soon as possible
     </em>
     . This means apologizing as soon as you realize your mistake. This means not letting things fester. 
                This means admitting you're wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it's an interpersonal issue, the two outcomes of not addressing a mistake are much worse than overzealously copping to it immediately. 1- you'll sweat 
                over what the other person(s) think about you and 2- they might come to resent you even if they don't show it. Apologize immediately and without shame; 
                at the very least they'll know you didn't mean to do whatever heinous act it was. Related - it's ok to send an email/text with a mistake and follow up 
                with a correction.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it's a personal issue, it's much easier to put off resloving issues. I've been doing this since my first homework assignment. But now that 
                I'm not in school and have evermore responsiblities to tend to, any procrastination comes back to bite me in a more personal, directly affecting way. 
                100% of the time, I always wish I'd done things sooner, right when I realized it was an issue.

      Nip small things in the bud as soon as they pop up. E.g. cleaning up things quickly, writing down a thing you don't want to forget
     </li>
     <li>
      Getting things done quickly also makes you feel good and productive even if the task is small.
     </li>
     <li>
      People forget about things you do very quickly - apologizing leaves a better taste than an unacknolwedged mistake.
     </li>

      People who admit when they're wrong are more trustworthy IMO.

     For a long time I was super frugal. I relied on holiday gifts and saving up allowance/extra lunch money as an 'income'. Now that I have a real big boy job
                I also have some real big boy money. It's been a slow process but I'm learning just how worth it it is to splurge on the right things. Convenience, unique 
                opportunities/experiences,
     <em>
      good food
     </em>
     , long term items, and life affirming items are all worth the X% extra they always seems to cost. Conversely, 
                it's probably for the better that certain less wholesome items give me pause - e.g. new video games, fancy phones, drinks at clubs.

      When you have limited resources - e.g. in-game currency, some # of candies left - you don't have to ration it to the extreme. A lot of the time 
            there's no reward for saving a lot of it for the end. Consume as you please, but savor it.

     What makes something worth doing? If I make a stop-motion movie and one second of the final cut
              took me one hour to film, then I would need 3600 viewings to "break even" time-wise.
