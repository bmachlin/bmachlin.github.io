                I just watched <outlink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDR5j30spfI">this video</outlink>
                about language and where English words come from and evolve. There was 
                <outlink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDR5j30spfI&lc=UgyDqhiaaJQzqPXoz9N4AaABAg">a comment</outlink> by user KingLoop13:

            <blockquote>
                ...particularly with regards to the floor cushions and Hindu stance, these were old guard traditions that existed 
                for maybe her mother and grandmother but had certainly changed in the last 100 years, especially with the continued 
                influence of colonial British presence in the region. Many Indians had migrated to Singapore in the 1800s and early 
                1900s and missed out entirely on the cultural evolution that took place throughout that time.

                I'm sure there is a boatload of research done on exactly this topic - language and cultural evolution between homeland and diaspora. 
                But I'd like to let my brain wander on its own. I couldn't help but be reminded of a similar idea that I use most days in my job. 
                It's a program that deals specifically with this issue, albeit the units are lines of code, not word definitions/pronunciations/connotations.
                The program is of course <em>git</em>.
