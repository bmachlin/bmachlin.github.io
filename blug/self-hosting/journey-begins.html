        <h1>The Self Hosting Journey</h1>
        <h4>January 18th, 2023</h4>
        <section>
            <p>
                Here begins my exploration of self hosting. I have only scattered knowledge on the topic.
                I have a lot of adjacent experience but haven't had to actually do it all.
                I'm going to document what I know (or *think* I know) and what I learn along the way.
                Hopefully this will be useful to someone else.
            </p>
            <h2>What I Think I Know</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-hosting is having control over a server, on which you can serve whatever you want.</li>
                <li>A server is just a computer; it can live in your office, in a server farm, or only exist as an abstraction and not really be tied to a specific physical computer.</li>
                <li>A server serves things, usually via the Internet, and in the case of websites, through HTTP(S).</li>
                <li>A program that runs on your server and serves things is called a service.</li>
                <li>A port is an entry point into the server (hence the term). A server "listens" "on" a port by having a service wait for incoming messages specifying that port number.</li>
                <li>Some services need to use specific ports, like HTTPS which uses port 443. Many of the lower number ports are reserved.</li>
                <li>Not everything on the server should be exposed to the Internet. Some of it is only accessed to support other services, e.g. a database.</li>
                <li>There are many many security risks.</li>
                <li>For my website I want to use React for the frontend, Django or Ruby on Rails for the backend, and PostgreSQL for a database. (Subject to change)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I Think I Need To Figure Out</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are several layers in between a client (e.g. my personal laptop) and a server. What are they? Which do I need to use/configure for my server to serve and which do clients need to use/configure to access my server?</li>
                <li>What service(s) do I need to run on my server to host my website?</li>
                <li>The backend framework for my website will run on the server, but are the frontend resources (e.g. HTML pages) also hosted on the server?</li>
                <li>Does my server have a static IP? Does it need to for certain things to work?</li>
                <li>What is a reverse proxy and do I need one?</li>
                <li>What exactly is a webserver? Like Apache or Nginx</li>
                <li>DNS, domain name, SSL cert, and other misc. bureaucratic stuff, what do I need to take care of?</li>
                <li>What of all of this will I need to pay for? How much? Are there reliable free-tier or open-source versions?</li>
                <li>How do I keep my server secure within reason?</li>
                <li>Should I use containerization/Docker?</li>
                <li>How do subdomains work/is it easy?</li>
                <li>Which parts of this do I want to learn about and which parts do I want to wave a magic wand at?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My plan is to tackle each question (and the countless follow ups) one at a time and document my findings until I have something working.
                <br>
                Let's get started!
