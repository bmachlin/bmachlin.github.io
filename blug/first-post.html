                This is my first blug post. I'm making this section of my website because 
                sometimes I have a thought that I want to express with the aid of 
                computers and formatting and variables. Maybe it's something I want to link 
                to someone I know or share with the world at large. It might save time in 
                the long run to use some sort of blugging framework, but for now the inconveniences 
                are minor and will only happen when I actually make a post!
