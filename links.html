                        <p>When an incentive creates results opposite to what was intended. Funny origin story: </p>
                        <blockquote>The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. 
                            Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. 
                            Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. 
                            When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. 
                            When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Participants saw their amateurish creations – of both utilitarian and hedonic products 
                            – as similar in value to the creations of experts, and expected others to share their opinions.</blockquote>

                            Parkinson's Law states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." 
                            While Hofstadter's Law states: "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
                            Therefore work will <em>always</em> take as long as you plan and <em>always</em> some more time after that.

                        <p>
                            The line of reasoning is that more people are more knowledgeable on less complex things and will have something to say. 
                            The other reason being people want to look like they're contributing and will pipe up about things they know about. 
                            The canonical example is a committee building a power plant will spend a ton of time talking about the bike shed over the 
                            actual power plant itself. I feel like this "law" is a good one to remember because it'll happen to you and you'll 
                            chuckle to yourself while the people in your meeting drone on.
